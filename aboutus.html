    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Christian Youth Ministry (CYM) of the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa began as a small fellowship group and has grown into a youth-driven outreach programme. We provide mentorship, Bible studies, and community service projects such as food drives and skills development workshops.</p>

    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To empower young people spiritually, emotionally, and socially by helping them build a strong foundation in God and by serving the needs of their communities.</p>

    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To see a generation of youth rooted in faith, living with purpose, and transforming society through service and love.</p>
